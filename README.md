## Choices were made

### create-react-app

Just for the quick start

### antd as a main component library

Might be a bit heavy just for the lightweight application like this, but it has really huge amount of components easy to extend and customize, supports themes and tree-shaking, has a nice interface and is maintaining very actively

### react-helmet(-async)

Was chosen for improving SEO

### recoil as a state manager (just for the user)

Easy to setup, easy to test. Was added only for storing logged in user.
